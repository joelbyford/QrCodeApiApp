## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please simply submit an Issue to this repo and it will be responded to as quickly as possible. 

If the steps to reproduce should remain confidential (to prevent exploit in the wild), please provide an email address, Discord handle, or other contact mechanism in the Issue where you can be reached offline and I will contact you offline.
